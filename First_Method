'''
This takes in four columns for each question and
create a new column that sums each row. If the 
resulting sum is greater than 1, it means that the
respondent has marked more than one option. So, we
will show it as 'M'. If the resulting sum is 0,
it means that the respondent has marked none of the
available options. So, we will show it as 'Z'. If
the respondent has marked exactly one option, then
we will find the idxmax of the four columns and 
return the particular column. 
Then we drop the four columns and retain the 5th
column and rename it to the corresponding question
number. Below is the generic code.

df.loc[df[4] == 1, 4] = df.loc[df[4] == 1, [0,1,2,3]].idxmax(axis=1)
